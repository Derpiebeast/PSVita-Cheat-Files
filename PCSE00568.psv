# Note: You only need to activate ‘MONEY HELD’/‘SIM POINTS HELD’ once. Otherwise it will stay 9999998M.
# Note 2: ‘SIM POINTS HELD 9M’ will change Noire’s Sim points status to ‘Rich’.
# Note 3: Edit: These were made on Easy mode. For some reason after I tried using it on normal the game crashed. Might be pointers needed. Will fix soon.
