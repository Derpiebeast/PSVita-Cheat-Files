# Note: by Smoker1:
#  - This game needs a LOT of work to find the Codes. Was told by @Seven Swords, this Game is hard to get correct Codes for, but thankfully I found what I could.
#  - 1.02 is for the Update
#  - Laser Code I found works as $0200 for both.
#    - 5 Shields Code is maybe Dynamic. In my Search, I found 5+ Addresses for it. So this Game uses a mix of Coding.
#    - For the US Version, use the same Searching as shown here.
#  - 3 Mega-Bomb = Easy Search, 8Bit - 3, 2, 1
#  - 5 Lasers = Same as above
#    - Then use Fuzzy Search to find the Floating Value Address
#    - Can use Codes together as 1 Cheat but use $0200
#  - 5 Shields = If you can find this, please Post in Comments
#  - Shield Gauge and Aircraft Health % are both Floating Value and are Dynamic. Shield Gauge might need Multi-Pointers, since TempAR Pointer Searcher did not show Highlighted Address Lines.
