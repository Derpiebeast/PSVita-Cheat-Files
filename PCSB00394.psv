_V0 #1: See wiki for details.
$0000 00000000 00000000 # Now with some luck he shouldn't learn any new skills as I have it done in a way that the free slots are all set as zanmato but will continue to test it to see if he does learn anything else, also since his garment grid/dressphere has been modified i'd avoid his equipment page as it asks you to choose a dressphere but you don't need to for this particular usage, also make sure he is in the party beforehand as if you apply the code and then swap him in it forces you to choose a dressphere for him
