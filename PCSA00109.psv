# Note: This Game has 2 different Code Types. A 1st Run (Play for the 1st Time) and a Normal Type. For example:
#  - When you run the Game for the 1st time, and run a Table, the Codes will use 1 Address. Then the next time you run it and beyond, it will be the Normal Address System. So far, only have the PAIN and Bowling Table Codes. These should give you a idea of where the Addresses should be.
#  - The Tilt Code is a Problem, so it needs to be looked at.
